# Flask For Desktop - starter

## So you've just aquired the starter pack

You will find a ready to use organisation for medium sized applications. 
Some files are populated with examples, in
'models.py' and 'views.py', just replace the code as you wish.

- The executable for 'flask for desktop' is, obviously, `flask_for_desktop.py`. Its
function is to wrap the actual flask application, and provide the indicator icon. 
Just read its content and follow the 3 steps indicated in the comments (takes 5 minutes).

- the actual flask application entry file is `flaskapp/main.py`, you should use this one
directly in development.

- about the icon: change it for yours, but it must remain a .png file.



## Ready to use

Take a look at the provided files.

Once you have made your own models, do not forget to make the migrations from
the 'flaskapp' directory.


## Installer for linux

With the starter pack you find an installer for linux(from 'Geninstaller'). 
If you want to make your application integrated on a linux system, it is the 
fastest way to do that. And get you rid from any tideous packaging task.

Very easy to configure, just read the python code in the installer, 
as you have some python basics, you'll be done within 5 minutes.


Enjoy :)

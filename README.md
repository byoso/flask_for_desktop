# Silly Gui

If you are a web developper, then you are a desktop developper too.

Silly Gui allows to simply shell any web application to convert it
into a desktop application.


# Why should I use it instead of PyGObject or tkinter or else ?

Simply to save some time if you already know flask or django.


# How it works

Basicaly, when the app is launched, silly-gui runs the server needed
by your web application localy and hidden, you can then show your app
in a desktop window and/or the main browser of the user's system.

The user's experience is similar as a 'electron' application, but there
it is python inside instead of JS.
